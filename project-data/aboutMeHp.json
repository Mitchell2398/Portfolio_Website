    "introduction": "In 2020, as I embarked on my second year of business studies, although I had learnt valuable business theory, something was missing. I yearned for a more hands-on experience which led me  to the realm of front-end development.",
  
    "drive": "I began absorbing a plethora of resources—books, videos, and courses—immersing myself in the vast realm of programming, with a particular focus on JavaScript. It was during this self-guided exploration that I finally experienced the exhilaration I had been yearning for.",
  
    "dedication": "Since then, I have invested countless hours in bringing my ideas to life and constructing my own projects from scratch. I take pride in the fact that all of my projects are unique and stem from my genuine desire to build something meaningful, rather than being mere checkbox exercises. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and I hear from you soon!"
