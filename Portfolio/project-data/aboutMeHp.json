    "aboutMe": "In 2020, I was entering my second year of business studies at the height of Covid-19, and I hated it! My need to create new things and solve complex problems were not being met, which drove me to embark on what would turn out to be a difficult but rewarding journey.\n\nI started devouring books, videos and courses on web development and discovered the joy I had not been able to find in business. Since then I have been working hard on building my own projects and turning ideas into life.\n\nI am an eager learner and a deep believer in self-teaching new skills. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and if you have any feedback please send it to Jacksporfolio22@gmail.com ðŸ˜Š."
